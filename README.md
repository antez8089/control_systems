# Control Systems Analysis and Design

## About
This project focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of various control strategies using MATLAB and Simulink. The goal is to explore different approaches to controlling dynamic systems while evaluating their performance and limitations.

## What I Implemented
- **Regulators:**
  - **DMC (Dynamic Matrix Control):** Model Predictive Control algorithm for handling multivariable systems and constraints.
  - **PID Controller:** Classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller for tuning and disturbance rejection.
  - **State Feedback Control:** Design and tuning of controllers using state-space representation.
- **System Analysis:**
  - Observability and controllability analysis to ensure that the system states can be fully controlled and observed.
- **Simulations:**
  - Dynamic system modeling and simulations using Simulink to visualize system responses under various control strategies.

## What I Learned
- **Control Strategy Tuning:**
  - Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of PID, DMC, and state feedback controllers in handling disturbances and system dynamics.
- **Model Predictive Control (DMC):**
  - Deepened understanding of predictive models and how they can preemptively adjust to system changes.
- **State-Space Analysis:**
  - Practical application of observability and controllability to ensure system stability and performance.
- **Simulink Expertise:**
  - Leveraged Simulink for designing, testing, and visualizing control strategies in a structured environment.

## Tools Used
- **MATLAB:** For algorithm implementation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Simulink:** For modeling and simulating dynamic systems and controllers.
